I am Yongzhe Wang (永哲), a biostatistician at [City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.cityofhope.org/) working at the intersection of clinical research, cancer epidemiology, and statistical methodology. My work focuses on developing and applying rigorous statistical approaches to real-world biomedical data, with particular interests in survival analysis, high-dimensional modeling, and causal inference in observational settings. I am especially motivated by problems where statistical methods must align closely with clinical decision-making rather than operate as purely technical tools.

What I am doing now...
======
I am currently a biostatistician at the cancer center, where I work on clinical and population-based cancer research with an emphasis on __breast cancer__ and other __hormone-related malignancies__. My work focuses on analyzing real-world clinical and registry-based observational data to understand __cancer outcomes__, __treatment patterns__, and __disparities__ across patient populations.

A central part of my role involves developing and applying rigorous biostatistical methods—particularly __longitudinal and survival models__, __quasi-experimental designs__, and __causal inference__ approaches—to address questions that arise from routine clinical practice rather than idealized experimental settings. I frequently collaborate with clinicians and researchers to translate complex biomedical and clinical data into evidence that can inform treatment decisions, health policy, and future study design.

What I am interested...
======
My interests center on causal inference and survival analysis for real-world clinical data, with a focus on breast cancer research using __EHR and multi-omics data__. I study cancer outcomes, treatment heterogeneity, and health disparities, with particular emphasis on biomarker discovery and clinically interpretable modeling. I am motivated by methodological problems that arise from routine clinical practice and by making complex analyses actionable through clear __data visualization__.
